Particle system driven granular synthesiser for Max/MSP/Jitter.

DEMO: https://youtu.be/pLePtIZSEB0

This is a project file for Max 8+, containing all the dependancies and media files for the provided examples.

This contains two versions:
 1) The standard version that uses the Leap Motion, designed for a normal 2D screen.
 2) A version for use with VR HMD (this uses Graham Wakefield's VR external.
 

Dependancies:
 - IRCAM Leap Motion external (included, but you may need to download and copy across some files from the original package which you can find here http://ismm.ircam.fr/leapmotion/ )
 - Graham Wakefield's [vr] objects for Max (available in the Package Mangager)
 - Java runtime for the binaural panner in VR mode (since it uses an MXJ object)

CURRENTLY ONLY TESTED ON WINDOWS WITH THE OCULUS RIFT AND LEAP MOTION

Simply open the .maxproj file in the main folder and it should start rendering the visuals and outputting audio straight away.
