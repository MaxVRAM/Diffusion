Particle system driven granular synthesiser for Max/MSP/Jitter

This contains two versions. One that uses the Leap Motion, designed for a standard screen.
The other which uses Graham Wakefield's VR external (only tested with Oculus CV1).

The VR version also includes binaural panning, which uses the MXJ object (so needs Java runtime installed).
